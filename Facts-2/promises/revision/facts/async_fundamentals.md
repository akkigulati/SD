Promises Basics
Promise => assurance of a work that could be completed in future
Promise could either resolved or rejected once in a life time
Promise => states 1. Initial: Pending [] 2. Final => resolved ,reject[]
if you call resolve => final => promise will resolve with value passed in resolve fn[] if you call reject => final => promise will reject with value passed in reject fn[]
To consume a promise we have two Synchronous functions then/catch .They are used to register cb fxn to that promise
cb of any promise will only execute when promise recieved from it get into it's final state
cb fn passed through then and catch are async
then and catch also returns a promise
final state of promise returned from then/catch depends upon value returned from there cb =>scb,fcb if cb returns then your promise will resolve into val=>val nothing=> undefined promise=> promise err fcb => will call fcb and err as it's message err=> propogate
then have two cb => scb ,fcb, fcb => optional
catch => catch(fcb)=> then(undefined,fcb)
