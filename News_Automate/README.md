# NewsFb_Automate
I have implemented an automation script using puppeteer and NodeJS. It consists of two parts:

## News Scrap
It will scrap the details of the top N trending news like headline & Link to the news and downloads the image.
Data will be stored in News.json file.

## Facebook Automate
**(Please modify FBCredential.json before running the script)**
Second part of script include successfully loging in facebook & then posting the news one by one which includes headline with Link and uploading image of the news.
